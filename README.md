#### Description:
#####  Indroduction:
Hello, I am Devin from Berlin, Germany, and this is my final project for CS50. Last year I graduated highschool and this year I will be starting my biology technican trainee program. I am excited to show you CipherVaultâ€”a password generator! To generate strong and secure passwords to keep your account online safe.

#####  Evolution:
I  initially  had  the  ambitious  plan  to  build  a  website  that  would  allow  users  to  discover  new  songs  on  Spotify using the Spotify API. Users  could  hover  over  each  song  to  listen  to  the  best  parts  before  deciding  whether  they  liked  it  by  viewing  song  thumbnails  in  a  grid. I  chose  to  look  into  other  options  after  realizing  the  complexity  of  the idea.

#####  The new concept:
I  decided  to  create  a  web  application  that  would  manage  passwords  after  more  brainstroming. Users  can  safely  store  and  manage  their  login  information  for  a  variety  of  websites  using  the  password  manager. My  main  goal  was  to  design  a  sleek and modern website.

#####  Implementation:
1. **Register and Log-in Logic** I started by working on the registration and login functionality, considering it as a good starting point. This part came relatively easy, and it provided a great start for the project.
2. **Password Generation Logic** Implementing the password generation logic turned out to be more straightforward than I initially anticipated. Users can now easily generate strong and secure passwords for their accounts by a click of a button. They can also modify the password to their liking, by for instance removing symbols.
3. **Challenges with HTML and CSS Layout:** The  HTML  and  CSS  layout  was  the  part  of  the  project  that  I  found  to  be  the  most  difficult. Aligning  items  became  a  difficult  task  as  I  moved  into a  more  complex  design. I  had  trouble  getting  my  CSS  grid's  elements  to  properly  align. I  eventually  overcame  these  challenges,  though,  after  watching  numerous  tutorials and constantly trying.

#####  Unresolved Tasks:
2. **SQL Password Manager** Although I intended to create a SQL database to store users' login data securely, I encountered complexities that I wasn't fully prepared for at this stage. As a result, I haven't implemented this feature .
3. **Register and Log-in Functionally** Although the functions serve no purpose. I chose to retain the register and log-in functions, beacuse their desgin is appealing to me and I hope they showcase my progress in building user interfaces.

#### Conslusion:
The CS50 course has been an incredible experience for me. I am pleased with my accomplishments so far and am eager to continue my journy as a developer. The password manager I built is a big achievement for me, beause it demonstrates my ability to complete a project, even though some features still remain unimplented.
